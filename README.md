A simple app for showing live departures for Lonon bus stops.


Description
===========

From time to time in London you'll need to catch a bus, and some lucky bus stops have live departure boards, but not all do. To help, this app shows a live departure board of any bus stop in London. To see bus stop for a particular area please move to that location in map, it only shows bus stop for an area which is visible to you in a map.

And to see schedule for a bus top please click bus stop.
